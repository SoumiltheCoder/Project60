        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My name is Soumil Das. I study in standard 6 . My favourite hobby is cricket and Lawn Tennis.</p>
        <p>
            Cricket is my favorite sport. Cricket is the game which requires physical fitness. The running between the wickets, fielding within the ground and stress bearing during batting and fielding make my body fit and mind fresh. So, after playing cricket when I study, I can better grab the concepts. I also become delighted by playing cricket because I donâ€™t waste my mind sitting in front of a computer or playing video games. Instead, I do some healthy activity. On every Sunday evening, I have two or three hours free. Mostly, I play cricket at that time. I enjoy watching cricket matches at home. </p>
        <p>My another hobby is Lawn Tennis. I take coaching in Vazirani National Sports Academy since more than three years now.
           Tennis is a sports that requires lot of flexibility, patience and strength. My favourite tennis player is Roger Federer.
            It is a very interesting game.--Soumil Das </p>

        <p> I am  a student I do  coding, play lawn tennis, cricket, chess and reading story books. When I get some time I write short stories to capture my travel memories with my dad and mom. During lockdown I have tried my hands in baking under my mothers supervision and I enjoyed it.   </p>
